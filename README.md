# BusMall 
### Like SkyMall but for buses!

Help Busmall choose which products to place on their store by choosing the product you would most likely purchase. You will be offered 3 choices each round, select which product of the 3 displayed you would choose. Below the image display area are instructions.

Each set of images is displayed for set number of rounds and does not repeat images in the current round in the next round.  Views and votes are recorded in memory and once the round is completed the data is placed in localStorage.  During each round a tally list on the left displays the current round and views and vote count.  After the rounds are complete it displays a chart of the votes for each image in the part of the screen where the instructions and images were.  

This app uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, ChartJS, an Event listener,  and localStorage.
